Mock Exchange Server
================================

You do not need to know anything about this server to complete this project. This information here is provided in case you are curious.

If the server stopped running or if you closed it accidentally, double click "startserver.bat" on the desktop to start it again.

The server keeps a list of available stocks and updates the market price per share for each of them every 5 seconds using a fluctuation prediction. The previous trend (rising or falling) has a 60% of continuing. The range of fluctuation for each iteration is -3.0% to +2.999999%. The minimum price is $1.00.

The server provides two Restful API access paths:

GET /quote?symbol=[symbol]

will return an array of matching stocks, it's full name and it's market price per share in a data structure like this (usually only has one stock since symbols are supposed to be unique):

[
    {
        "symbol" : "SYM",
        "fullName" : "full name of the stock",
        "price" : 9.99
    }
]

GET /listing?match=[pattern]

will return an array of matching stock symbols and full names that have a partial string of pattern in its symbol or full name. It is returned in a data structure like this (empty array if no match):

[
    {
        "symbol" : "SYM1",
        "fullName" : "full name of stock 1",
    },

    {
        "symbol" : "SYM2",
        "fullName" : "full name of stock 2
    }
    
        .
        .
        .   
]
